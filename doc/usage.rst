The Graph Processor project aims to develop an infrastructure for rapidly analyzing and evaluating Wikipedia's category structure. The `GraphCore <https://github.com/jkroll20/graphserv/>`_ component maintains and processes large directed graphs in memory. `GraphServ <https://github.com/jkroll20/graphserv/>`_ handles access to running GraphCore instances.

This file documents GraphServ usage.
